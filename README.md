⚜️ CollabSphere: Imperial Reserve (v15.0)Advanced Influencer Intelligence & Strategic RAG AnalyticsCollabSphere Imperial Reserve is a premier, enterprise-grade intelligence suite engineered for high-stakes influencer marketing. By merging a Midnight Obsidian & Gold executive interface with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it transforms raw spreadsheets into actionable strategic assets.💎 Core Architecture & Capabilities1. Neural Strategy Vault (RAG)Utilizes LangChain and ChromaDB to index over 350+ influencer nodes. The system performs semantic vector searches, allowing executives to query the database using natural language (e.g., "Identify high-ROI creators for a luxury launch in Mumbai under 50k").2. Triple-Layer Nuclear Data EngineA fail-safe ingestion pipeline designed to prevent KeyErrors and data corruption:Semantic Mapping: Intelligently maps varied CSV headers (e.g., 'Cost', 'Fee', 'INR') to a unified schema.Index Fallback: A safety-net logic that maps data by column position if headers are missing.Deep-Regex Cleaning: Automatically strips currency symbols and non-numeric artifacts to ensure mathematical precision in ROI calculations.3. ROI DNA MatrixA proprietary normalization algorithm that plots influencers on a Comparative Radar Chart. It balances three critical vectors:Performance Density: (Engagement Rate Normalized)Market Authority: (Reach/Follower Saturation)Capital Efficiency: (Investment vs. Output Ratio)🛠️ Technical StackLayerTechnologyFrontendStreamlit (Custom Glassmorphism CSS)LLM EngineMeta Llama 3 (via Ollama)Embeddingsmxbai-embed-largeVector StoreChromaDBProcessingPandas / NumPy / Regular ExpressionsVisualizationPlotly High-Fidelity Graphics🚀 Deployment OrchestrationPrerequisitesOllama Framework: Models: llama3, mxbai-embed-largePython: Version 3.9 or higherInstallationBash# Clone the Imperial Repository
